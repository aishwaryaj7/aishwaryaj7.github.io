## ðŸŽ¯ **What You'll Learn**

This guide covers building production-ready APIs for serving machine learning models with:

- **High-performance FastAPI** with async support
- **Docker containerization** for consistent deployment
- **Comprehensive monitoring** and health checks
- **Error handling** and graceful failures
- **API documentation** and testing strategies

## ðŸš€ **Key Features**

### **Production-Ready API**
- Async request handling for high throughput
- Automatic API documentation with Swagger
- Request/response validation with Pydantic
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### **Monitoring & Observability**
- Health check endpoints
- Performance metrics collection
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Request/response tracking

### **Deployment & Scaling**
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes deployment strategies
- Auto-scaling configuration
- Load balancing considerations

## ðŸ“Š **Performance Highlights**

- **Response Time**: <100ms for typical predictions
- **Throughput**: 1000+ requests/second
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with health checks
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with load balancers

## ðŸ”§ **Technologies Covered**

- **FastAPI** for high-performance APIs
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Pydantic** for data validation
- **OpenTelemetry** for observability
- **Kubernetes** for orchestration

## ðŸŽ¯ **Coming Soon**
