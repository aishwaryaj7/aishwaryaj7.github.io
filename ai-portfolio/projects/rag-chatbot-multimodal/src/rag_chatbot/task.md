Topic: Full-Stack RAG Chatbot with Multi-Modal Docs (RAG + LLMs + Agentic AI)

I am trying to build a production grade project (code + some appropriate publicly available dataset for the above topic. Ideally multi-modal datasets with sufficient complexities)

Problem: Build a RAG pipeline using LangChain + Weaviate that ingests invoices, contracts (PDF, images), and answers queries over them. Add audit logs & error tracking. 




Goals to acheive when building this project

1. Tools I want to cover in this project: LangChain, Weaviate/Qdrant, Pinecone, FastAPI, OpenTelemetry, FASTApi or any other latest most popular python package for openieng endpoints. 

2. Do not use old python packages like os, sys, etc... If new high start git repos are available --> consider using them

3. In the end I want to write a 3 part article about the overall project that I built such that a begineer can understand everything End2End with minimum effort. Blog: “Building an Industry-Grade RAG Pipeline with PDF, Images & Logs”. Considering the source code in the blog pieces wherever required.

4. I want to use MKDocs to host the blog content you write in *.md file (in step 3) and host and test everything is working fine. Setup everything in dependencies, eg., terminal commands, toml files etc...

5. I am not too sure about the dataset that will be the best fit for this task so consider searching on internet and download the most relevant ones you think can be sued to build the whole project. A sample number of records are also enough for the task It doesn't have be in Gigabytes. Ultimately my goal is to learn all these technologies and its okay to keep the not so essential parts a bit simple (So I can focus on the important learnings)



End Note: Finding datasets will take a lot of time, cleaning them, and building ETL pipeline ensuring best and latest industry practices. So do everything in a clean an organized python package structure. Keep iterating until you get sufficient quality and modality of datasets such that my end RAG applicaiton has a wow factor in it. I want to host the application on a local server so you can consider using any simple API development framework (my favorite is FastAPI)


If somehting is ambiguous and unclear. Consider taking feedback from me. Keep iterating so as to ensure you are developing coherently and make sure the blogs look very attractive to the reader and highlights my skills.
